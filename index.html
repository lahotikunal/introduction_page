    <p id="text-area">Welcome to Lucky 7.!</p>

<p id="text-area"> As you start the game, bidding value is fixed to 1500000,an initial sum of 9000000 is provided. To proceed, select one of the 3 options : “<7” , “=7” or “>7“ – which correspond to the sum of the numbers that would be rolled on the dice. Once you’ve made this choice, roll the dice. If your chosen option is correct, based on the numbers rolled on the dice, twice the bet amount would be added to your total, else, the bet amount would be deducted. Additionally, if you chose “=7” the amount added would be three times the bet amount, while the deduction on failure would be the same. 
You will be given a option of insurance at a certain point, if you choose to select insurance your loss will be compensated(no money will be removed in case of loss) but an insurance premium will be removed from your total amount at each roll. If you win you get the winning amount minus the premium amount added to the total sum.
Have Fun!
